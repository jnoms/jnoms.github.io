I am a Principal Investigator at [AITHYRA](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/aithyra) as of October 2025. My lab uses protein structure, functional genomics, and artifical intelligence to investigate the virus-host conflict. We are hiring at all levels (staff scientist, postdoc, and technician). Please email me if interested, formal job advertisements are forthcoming. For those interested in doing a Ph.D., I am participating in the [AITHYRA-CeMM Ph.D. Program](https://apply.cemm.at/) - applications are due September 10, 2025.

I did my postdoctoral fellowship in the lab of Jennifer Doudna at the Gladstone Institutes from 2022-2025. As part of this work, I used protein structure to reveal the function of viral proteins. A special emphasis of my work was the identification of viral immune antagonists. As part of this work, I discovered a conserved mechanism of immune antagonism employed by viruses that infect animals and viruses that infect bacteria. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Virology from Harvard in 2022 in the labs of Jim DeCaprio and Matthew Meyerson. I led studies on diverse topics, including the role of oral bacteria in esophageal cancers, viral discovery efforts in human cancers, and the transcriptional dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and polyomaviruses. 

In 2017 I completed by BA in Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara, as part of the College of Creative Studies. As an undergraduate, I worked in the lab of Zach Ma to investigate the association between a histone methyltransferase subunit and Measles virus.
